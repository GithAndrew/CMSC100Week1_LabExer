		<legend class = "lgnd1">What are my Favorites?</legend>
        <fieldset id = "favorites1"><legend class = "lgnd2">Favorite CMSC subject so far and why</legend>
            <p>My favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 56. The thrill of proving and the satisfaction of being able to arrive at the final statement are some reasons why it's my favorite subject.</p></fieldset>
        <fieldset id = "favorites2"><legend class = "lgnd3">Favorite GE so far and why</legend>
            <p>My favorite GE is SOSC3. Learning about gender, sexuality, and the different spectrums under it were really eye-opening and informative, most especially for a late adolescent like me.</p></fieldset>
        <fieldset id = "favorites1"><legend class = "lgnd2">Favorite programming language so far and why</legend>
            <p>My favorite programming language is Python. All programming languages gave me a hard time when I was using them, however the least hardest was Python mainly because of its user-friendly syntax.</p></fieldset>
        <fieldset id = "favorites2"><legend class = "lgnd3">Favorite food</legend>
            <p>My favorite food is sinigang na hipon.</p></fieldset>
